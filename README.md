# Project Description
This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Using two datasets, fraudtrain.csv and fraudtest.csv, we explore how machine learning techniques can help identify fraudulent activities within a large dataset of transactions.

fraudtrain.csv: Contains historical data of transactions used for training the model. Each record includes transaction details such as time, amount, and features generated from user behavior.
fraudtest.csv: A separate dataset used for evaluating the model’s performance.
The primary goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately classifies transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate based on patterns identified from the training data. Various preprocessing techniques are applied to handle imbalanced data, followed by testing machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting.

# Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Includes handling missing data, scaling features, and managing class imbalance using techniques like under-sampling or SMOTE.
Feature Engineering: Creating additional features to better capture transaction patterns, enhancing model performance.
Model Building: Evaluating the performance of different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
Evaluation Metrics: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) to assess model performance.
# Conclusion and Outcomes
After testing various models and evaluation strategies, the following outcomes were observed:

Gradient Boosting and Random Forests performed the best in detecting fraudulent transactions, with high precision and recall rates.
Handling class imbalance was critical, as fraudulent transactions are rare. Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) significantly improved the model’s ability to detect fraud.
The use of feature engineering to capture user behavior and transaction trends added valuable insights to the models, enhancing overall accuracy.
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be effectively applied to detect credit card fraud, offering a robust system for identifying suspicious transactions in real-time.
